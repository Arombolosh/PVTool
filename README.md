# PVTool
A tool for dimensioning PV panels with PCM layers to increase efficiency

## Functionality overview

User selects:
- climate/location
- PCM material
- insulation material
- PV panel (from database or using own parameters)

Simulation predicts energy production (annual integral) for various PCM layer thicknesses and determines optimum of revenue increase in contrast to installation costs.
